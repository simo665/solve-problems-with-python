# Two Sum

So an this problem solvation i need to provide an array of numbers and a target numbers, and i need to find two numbers from that array that when summed together it will equal the target number.

### Example:
```py
numbers = [0,4,5,6,8]
```
#### and a target number:
```py
target = 10
```
#### So logically the output should be:
```bash
[1,2]
```
### Explanation:
#### We have: 
```py
numbers[1] + numbers[2] == target
```
#### so the output will be:
```bash
[1,2]
```
